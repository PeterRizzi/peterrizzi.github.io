# My personal website: petermrizzi.com
  
I'd been wanting to craft a personal website for a while, but with little web development experience, I wasn't sure where to start. After doing some research and experimentation, I found that the combination of GitHub Pages and Jekyll would give me exactly what I was looking for in developing a personal site: simplicity and scalability for new content. The Pages + Jekyll combo allowed me to write almost no HTML or CSS code in the development of my site. Markdown files were all that I needed to master -- a much simpler task than writing a web app from scratch in HTML/CSS or some clunky framework whose bells and whistles I didn't need. And for the times that I did need some HTML code, it could be embedded inside .md files. Jekyll's features like liquid and front matter made my site generation even easier. I didn't even have to set up a local testing environment, as changes to my repository appear live on the web within minutes (although this probably isn't best practice :) ). I benefited a lot from [Jim McGlone's guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) that I found on the web, and I used some of his formatting code. I also used [Minimal, a Jekyll theme for GitHubPages](https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal) and copied much of their source code for my own styling needs.
  
Next steps:

- Fix the nav links so that the padding isn't clickable
- Add more content
- Add more blog posts
- Cosmetic changes

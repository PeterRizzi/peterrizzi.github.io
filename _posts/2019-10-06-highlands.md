title: A Scottish Highlands Weekend

I wanted to make sure I jot down a few things about my trip to the Scottish Highlands this weekend! On Friday, we saw Oban and Oban distillery. The drive through the Trossachs was beautiful, and Oban was as well. The West Coast seems like the place to be for natural beauty.

On Saturday, we drove up to Inverness, passing through more beautiful nature and stopping at Glenfinnan on the way (Hogwarts Express place!). I really liked the Battle of Culloden -- the history of the Jacobite Rebellion and the exhibit itself were very good.

Finally on Sunday, the highlights were seeing Fort George and the working sheepdogs demonstration (Leault).

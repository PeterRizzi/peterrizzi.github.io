I just got back from a phenomenal trip to Amsterdam, and I wanted to spend some time writing about it. We got there early Friday morning, and Zev and I made our way into the city from the Ramada Schipol Airport where we were staying -- the other guys had some work to do.

It was rainy when we got off the train, but the first thing you see in Amsterdam Centraal is water to your left. I'm not sure what this body of water is called, but it separates Amsterdam from Amsterdam North (Amsterdam-Noord), a place that is supposedly very cool but that we didn't have the chance to visit. The station itself has an interesting, modern design. By the tracks, it is open-air, covered by a large half-cylindrical structure that looks like a sheet of metal from a distance and from below.

You can exit the train station by taking an escalator down and going out either direction, where walking tunnels will then lead you towards the city centre. There is an interior part of Amsterdam Centraal seen from the land-side which is a magnificent red brick building.

The first thing Zev and I were asked after leaving the station was "where's the nearest cafe?" by another tourist. Little did we know he did not mean a typical coffeeshop, but a weed cafe. As we made our way to the city centre, despite it being a rainy dreary day, it was clear that Amsterdam was beautiful. We walked around a bit marveling at both the beautiful architecture and canels, and the ridiculous number of tourists. As you walk around central Amsterdam, there is a clear touristy vibe with loads of chain department stores, quick bite food places and souvenir shops. However, it doesn't take away from the sheer gorgeousness of the streets, buildings and canals.

We decided to find a chocolate shop. With the humblest intentions, we ended up turning down an alley where on our left and right were glass windows surrounded by neon red lights with near-naked women smiling and gesturing at us to come visit. At 3 PM!!

When we finally found our chocolate shop, called Ganache, we found ourselves in a beautiful stone circular plaza. The shop was located in a beautiful building in the center of the circle, one of the oldest churches in Amsterdam.

The shopkeeper told us that sand circles you see surrounding the church used to have magnificent hundred-year-old trees, but just a few months ago, wind took down all of them. She saids there are plans to replant, but government officials will have to discuss it for a long time (haha). The chocolate shop was delicious, with a wide assortment of flavors to choose from and create your own bag.

Zev and I then went to the Rembrandt House. On our way there, we joked about not knowing whether Rembrandt was a painter or a style of painting, but by the end of our trip to Amsterdam, we had gained a great sense of the significance of Rembrandt's work throughout Holland and the world. Aside from seeing how the 17th century painter lived and worked in his original home, there were a number of other cool tidbits that made the visit worthwhile. I learned that people in this age slept sitting up for fear of blood rushing to their head while lying down, and this was exemplified by the small box beds throughout the Rembrandt House. We also saw a paint-making demonstration that helped put into context how challenging and expensive painting was back then, and how making precious paints is still challenging today. It was also interesting to learn about how modern researchers use technology to distinguish Rembrandt portraits and gain more insights into how he worked.

Afterwards, we met up with the other guys. We ate a great Chinese dinner at Oriental City, and then walked around the Red Light District before heading back to the hotel.

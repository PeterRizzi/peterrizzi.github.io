<strong>Brief Summary:Â </strong>The lone human survivor from a shipwreck carrying his immigrant zookeeper family and all of their animals to Canada, Pi Patel finds himself sharing a lifeboat with a bengal tiger named Richard Parker, and the two must work together in order to survive 227 days on the Pacific. Author Yann Martel tells the story, mixing in rich spiritual themes and great insights into animal-human interaction!

<strong>What I liked:</strong> The book is a fun, well-written story that ...

1) Provides great zoological perspective on animal-human interaction and animal life. The way I think about animals has changed after reading this book. A particular insight that impacts me is the idea that, as Pi describes, when we remove animals from the wild and place them in zoos, we aren't necessarily disrupting their livelihood by removing them from their "natural state." Life for animals in the wild is a constant predator-prey struggle, and bringing animals out of that environment into a comfortable zoo is something an animal enjoys, as they now no longer live in constant fear! Additionally, as long as an enclosure is spacious enough, just because it is smaller than the wild does not mean it is harmful to the animal. Animals in the wild are often nomadic not by choice but by necessity! As long as an animal is not visibly uncomfortable in its enclosure, we don't have to mourn that the enclosure is "too small."

<em>Aside:</em> I still think the giraffe enclosure in Houston Zoo is far too small -- these new revelations don't change the fact that some zoos do still exploit animals for profit.

2) Has incredibly-not-subtle spiritual undertones (let's call them OVERtones) that wrap the story together nicely! It is quite clear throughout the novel that author Yann Martel's main purpose for telling Pi's story is to give his readers reason to believe in God. Martel presents the idea of God in a form welcoming to the reader. In the beginning of the novel, the teenage Pi decides to practice Islam, Christianity, and Hinduism. None proves to be superior to the others, as Pi loves all three religions for different, unique reasons! After Pi and Richard Parker's miraculous survival, Pi's interrogators are, reasonably, non-believing of his story, and Martel uses this as a quite powerful allegory for believing in God (you'll have to read for yourself to see what I mean -- and trust me when I say it's a good one!).

<strong>What I didn't like:</strong> The lifeboat journey was too long and predictable. I found myself skimming through lifeboat chapters without skipping a beat with the rest of the book. I also think Pi's journey into different religions at the beginning of the novel dragged on a little long as well. Life of Pi would have been better as a shorter book that focused more on its message and less on specific tales of fishing from the side of the lifeboat.

<strong>Rating:</strong> 7.5/10 -- definitely worth a read!
